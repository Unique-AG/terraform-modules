      Public IP handling has been completely reworked:
      - Removed: Creation of Public IP within the module
      - Removed: Support for `public_ip_address_id` variable
      - Added: Optional `public_ip_resource_group_name` and `public_ip_name` variables to data source public IP
      - When no Public IP is specified, the module will rely on the Azure preview feature 'EnableApplicationGatewayNetworkIsolation'
        for private-only deployment (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-private-deployment)
  - kind: added
    description: "Ability to configure the http listener to use the frontend IP configuration with private IP address"
